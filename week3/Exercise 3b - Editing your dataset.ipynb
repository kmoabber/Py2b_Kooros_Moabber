    "Authors note: I actually encountered a very interesting issue initially working with this dataset. Pandas has a standard of setting empty inputs in the csv file to NaN (Not a Number) and is the traditional approach of working with missing data. If something is missing by default set it to NaN. However! if you remove the na_values below you will see that bean type is still just an empty string. To fix this I started by reseraching into the csv file and found that instead of the usual format col1val,col2val,col3val,,col5val where there is nothing between col3 and col5 there was instead a blank space i.e col3, ,col5. Upon further examining what this blank space represented it appears to be a special type of encoding for blankspaces namely \\xao0 (read some about it if you want to! Very interesting issue.) It can however be solved with the na_values parameter below. This is how it is working with data in real life! Things are never perfect:)\n",
